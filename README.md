# Apple Configurator IPSW Cache Updater
Automatically downloads the newest IPSW firmware file for all specified devices and places them in the Apple Configurator firmware cache.
This can be run manually or through a cron job.

All used device identiers must be placed in a file "identifiers.txt" in the same directory as this script.
The device identifiers look like "iPad5,11" and can be found by looking on sites such as IPSW.me
